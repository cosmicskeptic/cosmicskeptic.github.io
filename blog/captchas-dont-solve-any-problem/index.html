<p><small>Posted 2022-01-02 by <a class="stretched-link position-relative" href="https://cosmicskeptic.github.io/authors/cosmic-skeptic/">Cosmic Skeptic</a>&nbsp;&hyphen;&nbsp;<strong>3&nbsp;min read</strong></small><p>

          </div>
          
          <p>TLDR:</p>
<ol>
<li>Captcha doesn't work against rich people</li>
<li>Captcha exploits poor people</li>
<li>Metashit, Facebookshit supports predators by allowing nonsense advertisements</li>
<li>People who take captcha jobs usually earn no to less money and they learn nothing. It is net negative to people even if they were earning anything because it’s a futile task.</li>
<li>Captchas help bot because a bot can exploit these poor Indian/Pakisthan/Nepali workers.</li>
<li>The major reason predators can exploit is poor government policy (no punishment to these predators), poverty (If people were rich why would they need to work for $100?), lack of regulation in Facebook ads (Do government get money from Facebook ads?)?</li>
</ol>
<p>We are made to believe that captcha solves various problems like it prevents bots from the website? Is it true? Let’s see why I think Captchas are creating a black market and exploiting poor people in Asia.</p>
<p>First, there are websites like 2Captchas that boast themselves to be the best captcha solver. They also think they are doing charity by giving $100 per month. After that these website comes to Asian country because most of these countries are impoverished nation and many people are seeking jobs.</p>
<p>After that, the companies start doing mass advertising (Popular reason to hate Mr. Robotbuck who thinks he is doing a favor to small businesses) in Facebook. Facebook is the preferred platform because many people spend their time on Facebook especially in Asia. And they start putting ads like &quot;Are you jobless? We are here to solve your issue. You just need to type for us&quot;. Then, they start their skulduggery. They hire people but to get that job if they can pay initially. (How ridiculous is that? We do jobs to earn money but here people are ready to pay for this shitty job). They convince people that after paying they can earn money easily.</p>
<p>But when people start to do this job they realize its not typing job rather its captcha solving job. The 100wpm candidate starts to work hard because they think it is better than nothing (Something is better than nothing?) and they can at least earn money because they already have invested like $20 in getting entry to such job. They are also made to work hard because there is something called a leader board where they show people are solving 5k captchas per week.</p>
<p>After a month they realize they have been duped and they aren't going to get their money back. And some people reported that even if they are paid they get very few amounts like $100.</p>
<p>So, these predators succesfully hornswoggled the poor Asian. Government is busy with corruption and there are no laws that protect their right. Meanwhile, some rich people are running bots and probably earning in thousands of dollars. Captcha just makes it harder for normal people that why humans can never purchase the hot item from supreme.</p>
