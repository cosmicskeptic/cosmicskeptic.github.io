Advertisement has become unquitous in our society. They have proliferated more than virus. And sometime I wonder whether ads are dangerous or virus?

I am not going to discuss about privacy etc. here I am just going to specify why ads is dangerous.

Let's explore some ads I collected.

<div>
<img src="/img/advertising/1.png" alt="Ads" title="Youtube Ads" width="600"/>
</div>

The above image can be roughly be translated to "I take 3k usd per night if you want to meet please visit me". Is this legal? May be. But is it sign of good society where children can also see such ads?

<div>
<img src="/img/advertising/2.jpg" alt="Ads" title="Youtube Ads" width="600"/>
</div>

The above image says "Live Mobile Video Chat". We know the what video chat this means. How is youtube supporting small business by posting such ads?


<div>
<img src="/img/advertising/3.jpg" alt="Ads" title="Youtube Ads" width="600"/>
</div>

Putting sexual thumbnail has become trend in youtube. Is it necessary? Really? Am I absurd to think such ads should never come?


<div>
<img src="/img/advertising/4.jpg" alt="Ads" title="Youtube Ads" width="600"/>
</div>

Now here it comes the forceful ads that you need to see for 5 or 10 secs. And guess what you can't even skip it. So, youtube is supporting small business by showing women tities moving here and there. Will feminist speak about such issue?

Ahh Mark Zuckerberg seems to support small business by telling people like me "I am going to be Dad soon". Thanks Mark Zuckerberg for helping tiny gaming companies. Millions of teenager were wondering how to be dad and with your help they are going to be dad soon.

### It is cherry picking?
Obviously, it is but small thing like these can have huge impact tbh.

### How to be safe from Ads?
Disable facebook from your children phone and if they need to contact may be use safer option like Signal or Whatsapp (Not privacy friendly)?

For youtube disable the stock youtube app and Install youtube vanced.

If you are member from school I would recommend to ban social networking sites like Facebook and recommend signal. Please don't distribute news via Facebook and perphabs provide education on how one should deal with content on internet.
